## Getting started

We at CB-Geo aim to promote *open research* and create a friendly team of researchers working in the area of computational geomechanics.

* Please read our [welcome doc](https://doc.cb-geo.com/)

* To get you started, we would like you to do some online tutorials to familiarise yourself with the tools and software that we use in our research group. These tools / languages are really awesome and make your research life easier and blazing fast.

    + Unix (4 hours): [Unix command line interface (beginners)](http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/docs/course-notes/unix-courses/UnixCLI/notes.pdf)

    + Shell scripting (optional 2 hours): [Shell scripting for scientists](http://www.ucs.cam.ac.uk/docs/course-notes/unix-courses/ShellScriptingSci)

    + Introduction to HPCS and Familiarising with CB-Geo HPC documentation (2 hours): Accessing, submitting and monitoring jobs. SSH, Port-forwarding, SFTP and VNC.

    + Git for Version control (2 hours): [Learn Git in 15 minutes](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) and [a 2 hour course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)

    + Python (optional - 10 hours): [Python course on codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)

* We use [Slack](https://cb-geo.slack.com) to communicate within the research group. There are channels, which you can think of it like teams on *General*, *FEM*, *DEM*, etc., Unlike having an email you can go through the entire history of communication that has been happening, for example on using of High Performance Computing facility. You'll mainly use Slack to ask questions or post some nice tools you found on the corresponding channel. Everyone likes instant answers! so please be "online" as much as possible, at least during working hours. Support is a two-way street, the more you help, the more willing others will be to help you! We want you to participate in discussions / troubleshooting and help other team members with their issues. If you know the answer please respond. Don't worry if you think your solution might be wrong or silly, it might be a spark of genius, we might never know, if you don't tell. So do answer questions!

* From time-to-time we may ask you to write documentations / short reports to document a methodology or your approach.  This improves reproducibility and in general helps other users like you. Documentation is a nice habit. Who knows, you might not understand what you did / wrote or remember how you did it 6 months ago! Document it!


* Remember those frustrating times, when you thought if only I had the input files / code that the ex-PhD student used to validate your code or start your research? We don't like that to happen either. We expect you to share your input files, submission scripts and other files required to successfully run the simulations. These files will be stored on CB-Geo Git infrastructure internally and will be shared with other members of the group working on the same area / software. It is important to keep the knowledge within the team to avoid any repetitive work as well as to honour the contributions of the members. All research files shared on the central Git repository will be licensed under [Creative Commons - Attribution Share Alike 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) or a similar license. The researcher will own the copyright of their work. Don't worry, we won't share it without asking you or your supervisor.

* Do you have files named: [Thesis_Final_Version_22_Commens_45.pdf](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531)? That's a bad idea. Use a version control system (git) and store your documents / input files and other important codes as repositories on online git hosting sites such as [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in) or [Atlassian](https://bitbucket.org) (they all have free academic plans). Please do share your final version of thesis / reports, research-codes, and input files to promote knowledge sharing within the research group. Won't you like more people to be benefit from your work?

* We do have some great research software and tools! We encourage you to participate in development of research software and generic tools. Our research code aims to be consistent, follow style guides and rules when developing these tools. All our research codes will be available everyone in the team / group. Software and tools developed within the research group will be distributed as open source software under BSD or other similar licenses, unless where it is specifically agreed with the supervisor. No part of research development or files will be distributed without the researchers' or supervisor's consent. The aim is to promote openness in research and development. More eyes on code means fewer bugs and more accurate results! It's always good to have something where you can pop open the hood and look inside. You are expected to acknowledge the contribution of the group on any publication, where the key academics are not listed authors.

* [Darwin](http://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk), the High Performance Computing  cluster at Cambridge, runs fast parallel codes (including programs such as Abaqus). We do have to pay for using a blazing fast computing cluster. Discuss with your supervisor to  decide on how many core hours you would need per quarter. You can always use the free tier on Darwin.

If you have any questions please contact us at [info@cb-geo.com](mailto:info@cb-geo.com).
