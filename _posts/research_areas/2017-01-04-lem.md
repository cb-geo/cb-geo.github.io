## Lattice Element Method

Lattice Element Method (LEM) is a collection of simple one-dimensional elements that interconnect at lattice sites, which are regularly or irregularly positioned in space. The computational degrees of freedom are defined at the lattice nodes. The problem domain is discretised into Voronoi cells, whose centroid represent a lattice node. A lattice connects two-neighbouring nodes, and therefore the cells. Lattice elements are assigned elastic properties and strength criterion, which allows for modelling failure during loading. At a geological scale, lattices represent a continous medium, with or without anisotropy, in which discontinuties can be modelled as a breakage of lattices as elements exceeding a certain failure criterion or a natural pre-existing fracture. LEM has a fixed neighbourhood scheme, which enables faster computations. However, it is not suitable if the deformation and kinematic movements of rigid blocks govern the problem.

Fracturing can be simply modelled by removing lattice. LEM  simulates fracture flow using 1D pipe flow network. The fluid module is fully coupled with LEM such that the fracture permeability varies with fracture aperture.

## Main features

* Ability to simulate 3D geometries of complex reservoir.

* Ability to represent complex fracture mechanics (non-planar, branching, iteractions between natural and induced fractures, etc).

* Ability to simulate fully coupled fracture flows.


## Code

* The development version of the LEM code is now available at [GitHub](https://www.github.com/cb-geo/lem) 

* The docker image of the LEM code is available at [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cbgeo/lem/)

* The user documentation of the LEM code is available at [GitBooks](https://lem-doc.cb-geo.com)
