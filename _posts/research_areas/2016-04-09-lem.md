## Lattice Element Method

Lattice Element Method (LEM), also referred as Lattice Spring Model or lattice models, is often used to simulate fracturing process of heterogenous material. The basic elements in LEM are nodes and lattices. The nodes represent sub-domain called cell, and the lattices describe the interaction between two neighbouting cells. Lattice also represents the common face shared between two neighbouring cells. Unlike Discrete Element Methods, cells in LEM fill up the entire domain without any voids. Also, the neighborhood of nodes (or cells) is fixed in LEM, which eliminates the need for complex neighborhood search. Because of its simplicity, LEM is suitable for large scale problems. However, it is not suitable if the deformation and kinematic movements of rigid blocks govern the problem.

*LEM nodes, lattices and cells*

For a 3D problem, the basic units of LEM are 1D lattice elements. LEM can generate a disordered lattice network to represent local heterogeneity of reservoir and supports larger discontinuities. Fracturing can be simply modelled by removing lattice. LEM  simulates fracture flow using 1D pipe flow network. The fluid module is fully coupled with LEM such that the fracture permeability varies with fracture aperture. LEM uses efficient numerical solver which supports multi-core CPU / GPUs.

## Main features

* Ability to simulate 3D geometries of complex reservoir.

* Ability to represent complex fracture mechanics (non-planar, branching, iteractions between natural and induced fractures, etc).

* Ability to simulate fully coupled fracture flows.

* *Computational efficiency*. The 3D domain both in the solid and the fluid phase is represented by 1D lattices, which makes the computation highly efficient.
