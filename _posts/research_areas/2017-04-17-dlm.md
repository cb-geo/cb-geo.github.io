## Dual Lattice Element Method

### Introduction
In geomaterial, particular rock, is multi-scales and multi-physics in nature (Figure 1). Dual Lattice Model (DLM) is a novel technique by coupling solid lattice system and fluid lattice system (Figure 2). It also models fracturing process in multi-scale heterogeneous material, in particular, highly challenging hydraulic fracturing problem.

Figure 3 shows the basic elements of DLM: cells, lattices and nodes. 3D solid material sub-divided into cells by Voronoi tessellation. Solid lattice is a 3D representation of solid material while fluid lattice is a 2D representation of fracture flow. The model simplifies a multi-physics 3D problem into 1D lattice network. They are fully coupled and geometrically inter-dependent (Figure 3). The fracture surface, which is solid cell facets is represented by fluid node and their conductivity by fluid lattice. By such simplification, it has the capacity to handle multi-scale simulation.

As a discrete model, it is suitable to represent heterogeneous material and modelling processes which are disorder in nature such as fracturing. Not only several parameters prescribing the model or homogenised constitutive model as in continuum model. Statistical distribution can be specified which can be obtained by observation such as acoustic emission in laboratory scale and micro-seismicity in field scale.

### DualLattice3D package

A C++ DualLattice3D code is under development at the Cambridge - Berkeley Computation Geomechanics Research Group. It is a three-dimensional model. It includes 5 main modules:

* Pre-processing module: capacity of generating disorder lattice network, applying heterogeneity by including fractures and applying statistical distribution on lattice parameters.
* Geometry module: handling , Voronoi cells, dual lattices system and fracture facets
* A solid module: modelling deformations of lattice model and fracturing process.
* Coupled Solid-Fluid module : coupled fluid calculation using cubic flow law. 
* Post-processing module: Graphical output and statistical analysis. 

The solid lattice module has been validated by cantilever problem (Figure 4) for solid module and penny shape problem (Figure 5) for coupled solid-fluid module. Fracturing process of heterogeneous model is also carried out for parameter study (Figure 6).

A highly efficient parallelised preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Method which has capacity to handle millions of DOF problem in desktop computer, with future potential for large-scale simulation in High Performance Computer Utilising clusters of CPUs or GPUs. The solid-fluid coupling problem is handled by sophisticated numerical scheme for fast and stable solutions.

### Future potential
By the large scale 3D simulation of without expensive computational effort, realistic modelling of field with adequate details for capacity of practical applications including but not limited to hydraulic fracturing. By the advancement of computation power and rapid development of Machine Learning and optimisation algorithms, field data can serve as training data and produce an evolving model for better accuracy and provide predictive power which is the industry need (Figure 7).
